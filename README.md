## CODE QUIZ

Developed a code quiz that allows users to take a timed quiz and see/set their high scores. Used DOM manipulation and event handlers/timouts to achieve this. 


I used a object that holds all the questions and answer options as well as the index of the correct answers to populate the questions, and see if the user chose a correct answers. I kept track of the score and time with a few variables, and used a setInterval to handle the timer.
